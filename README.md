# Netflix-Clone-Website.github.io

"This project is a replication of the Netflix website, encompassing key elements such as a landing page, sign-in functionality, a simulated payment interface, and a home page. The home page dynamically utilizes an API to showcase movie images, while not providing access to full movies only YouTube links to movie trailers."
